# Android Prework - HelloWorld

Submitted by: Amogh Kapalli

HelloWorld is an android app that shows an image and introductory message, and allows pressing a button to display a Toast. It also allows for users to hear a dog bark and stopping this noise by clicking a different button to give the dog a treat.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] Image and introductory message displayed on screen
* [X] Button displayed on screen
* [X] Toast with message appears when button is pressed 

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Add an audio functionality to hear a dog bark and stop this bark.

Features I hope to add:
* [ ] Improve the UI design to make it more viewer friendly
* [ ] Use intents to create a seperate screen with a gif of a dog barking after the bark button is clicked.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

When building this app I didnt have any major challenges but when trying to extend additional features, I had trouble using the Glide library to implement adding a gif to the product. This is something I will continue to work on to extend additional features to this app.
