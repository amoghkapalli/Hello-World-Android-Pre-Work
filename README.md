# Android Prework - HelloWorld

Submitted by: Amogh Kapalli

HelloWorld is an android app that shows an image and introductory message, and allows pressing a button to display a Toast. It also allows for users to hear a dog bark and stopping this noise by clicking a different button to give the dog a treat.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] Image and introductory message displayed on screen
* [X] Button displayed on screen
* [X] Toast with message appears when button is pressed 

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Add an audio functionality to hear a dog bark and stop this bark.

Features I hope to add:
* [ ] Improve the UI design to make it more viewer friendly
* [ ] Use intents to create a seperate screen with a gif of a dog barking after the bark button is clicked.
